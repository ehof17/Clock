# What Happened Today 🌍

## Introduction 📖
**"What Happened Today"** is a dynamic web application that provides users with historical events for the current date. Leveraging the Meta-Wiki API, this project showcases my journey into web development, this being my first project ever.

## Features 🌟
- **Dynamic Date-Based Information**: Fetches and displays historical events based on the current date.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses a grid layout for a more flexible and adaptive user interface, moving away from fixed pixel widths.
- **Interactive Clock Feature**: Inspired by a YouTube tutorial ([JavaScript King HTML CSS JS projects (Beginner): 16 projects using HTML CSS and JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWv2jnhZErc&t=2510s)), the application includes a live clock that enhances user engagement.

## Technologies Used 💻
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web page.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and handle API requests.
- **Meta-Wiki API**: Used for fetching historical events.
- **Grid Layout**: Implemented for a more responsive design.

## Personal Contributions 👨‍💻
- **API Integration**: Independently integrated the Meta-Wiki API to fetch historical data.
- **Layout Redesign**: Revamped the layout using CSS Grid for better responsiveness and aesthetics.
- **Clock Feature Implementation**: Adapted and integrated the clock feature based on the referenced YouTube tutorial, with personal modifications.
